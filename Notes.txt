Things to do:

√ Implement the cursor
√ Overflow and extra line stuff
√ Wrap text and give a hover over for selecting stuff
√ Fix "repeat regex" problem with string.replace
~ Set up JSON file of "rules"
    * Parse the JSON file properly
    * Make sure there's no duplicate tags
- Handle overflow with line limit (happens after ~38 lines)
- Inserting the cursor into middle of some text (maybe have it hover over?)
- Cursor and select lines to copy and paste
- Pasting stuff
- Select things with cursor
- When a function is declared, have it's call link to its declaration
- Control codes (set difference for Mac and Windows)
    √ refresh
    * copy
    * paste
    * save
    * select all
    * undo
    * redo

Things to consider:

1. No mobile version. It'll just be too hard to implement. Instead have a page that explains why
2. What should we have in the rules?
    - tag: the name/ID of the rule
    - regex: the regular expression to search for
    - replace: what to replace
    - color: the color to identify it
    - html: what will be placed inside the modal
    - links: All the other tags to link to that have a relation to eachother
3. Useless information: "this is error code 24"

Extra stuff if there's time:

- "Grammar Checker": Check spelling for common words (ex: funciton -> function)
- Get a bunch of people to use it and then start doing data collection.
- Check if the code compiles and then show errors if it doesn't.

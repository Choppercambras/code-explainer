Things to do:

- Implement the cursor 
- Inserting the cursor into middle of some text (maybe have it hover over?)
- Cursor and select lines to copy and paste
âˆš Overflow and extra line stuff (DONE)
- Pasting stuff
- Select things with cursor
- Wrap text and give a hover over for selecting stuff
- Control codes
    * refresh
    * copy
    * paste
    * save
    * select all

Things to consider:

1. No mobile version. It'll just be too hard to implement. Instead have a page that explains why
2. What should we have in the rules?
    - tag
    - regex
    - color
    - discription

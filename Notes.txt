Things to do:

√ Implement the cursor
- Inserting the cursor into middle of some text (maybe have it hover over?)
- Cursor and select lines to copy and paste
√ Overflow and extra line stuff (DONE)
- Pasting stuff
- Select things with cursor
√ Wrap text and give a hover over for selecting stuff
~ Set up Json file of "rules"
√ Fix "repeat regex" problem with string.replace
- Control codes
    * refresh
    * copy
    * paste
    * save
    * select all
    * undo
    * redo

Things to consider:

1. No mobile version. It'll just be too hard to implement. Instead have a page that explains why
2. What should we have in the rules?
    - tag: the name/ID of the rule
    - regex: the regular expression to search for
    - replace: what to replace
    - color: the color to identify it
    - html: what will be placed inside the modal

Extra stuff if there's time:

- "Grammar Checker": Check spelling for common words (ex: funciton -> function)
- Get a bunch of people to use it and then start doing data collection.

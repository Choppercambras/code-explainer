Mon Feb 11 14:33:30 MST 2019 - Initial Log

	This is just a homemade log to keep track of what I've been doing with this project. A journal if you will. I primarily will list all the issues I've worked through up until this current day.

Mon Feb 11 14:52:44 MST 2019 - Problem with Finding Rules

	Rules, as I've set up this program to use, are each of the changes that will be used for each of the 'keywords' in current document. The only issue with this is that I'll have to have a unique card for each variable instead of one that can cover all of a single though. How do I fix this? Maybe a second parameter for the rule to check the current line to have that particular bit inside of it. I'll post an answer once I've got it figured out.

Mon Feb 11 21:30:08 MST 2019 - Came up with not the best solution, but one that works

	So what I did was seperate the problem into 2 databases: Constant keywords (like 'return' and 'function') from variable keyworks (like a function parameter or a numeric value). First, we'll try database (constant) which will have the names of the variables as a key. If not found, then we sequentially check the variable database which is based on a regex expression of the line given. If neithefound then it'll send a message to me. There still are many things that need to be worked out, but for now it's a working build... ish.

Tue Feb 12 16:27:24 MST 2019 - Implemented solution

	So I guess I figured it out. There might be some future bugs, but I think I have a few ways of solving those. One in particular is that the regex only checks if an expression is in the line instead of actually marking where. I suppose I could double up that with the 'index' and 'start' variables inside the program, but we'll address that issue when we get there. Till then, it's getting the database connected and testing that.

Thu Feb 14 22:27:12 MST 2019 - Got everything working. Including database

	So I was able to get the database finished and connected to the project so that's nice. I guess it's in full functionality right now. All I have to do is work out small bits of it, make it cleaner looking, finish the rules, and then I'm done. Of course theres a billion and one things I can do more, but I want a very basic build finished in the next few weeks so I candeploy and start data collecting. Tis important.

Mon Mar 11 12:08:56 MDT 2019 - Trying to get a new line saved into mongodb

	So there's a bit of a problem... whenever I try to save some html "pre-code" inside mongo (pre-code being a library to format code specifically on the page), it saves it as a string. However when I try to use it in the page, it renders it exactly as it's written, a nice property of the 'pre' tag. I have to find a way to override this or do something proper about it.

Fri Mar 22 12:17:07 MDT 2019 - Still having new line issues

	This kinda extends beyond a "new line" issue, it's with all literall characters, including quotation marks. Not sure what to do about this. Do I parse all the input and change it as it comes in? there has to be a better way...

Fri Mar 22 17:53:58 MDT 2019 - More than 50 parameters per query...

	First of all, I fixed the previous problem by having a "replace" function that would replace ever 'n' character with an actual new line. A quick and dirty fix eh? I know, but it works for now. I'll probably get bit by this technical debt sooner than later, but all I gotta do right now is convince the professors to accept this final projet. Anyway, I have a new problem. I'm not able to query more than 50 tokens using my '/get/rules'. Jquery simply wont let me, so I'm researching for a work around, but for now it's gonna be an issue.

Mon Apr  1 09:58:45 MDT 2019 - Troubles with cards reading duplicate situations (regex)

	So it turns out that some cards might read eachother a double time over due to the poor regex, but with practice that can be over come by using better regular expressions. It's required me so far to go and make changes to other "rules" but so far I've been successful. We'll just have to wait and see if it'll hold up for the next set of rules. Also I'm considering making a tool that will build the cards for you. I just question: will it be worth the time I put into it as opposed to just making the cards right now with my traditional method? Maybe as an extended feature to promote other people to use the application.

Wed Apr 17 22:52:15 MDT 2019 - Getting things finished up

	So I've worked out most of the issues. The trouble with duplicates was pretty easy: just have better regex which worked out well. Now I'm getting things deployed, but had some issues with that. Google Cloud was uncooperative so I had to use heroku instead which could have had some improvements, but hey, it's out and working now. Mazel Tov

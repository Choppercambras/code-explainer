Mon Feb 11 14:33:30 MST 2019 - Initial Log

	This is just a homemade log to keep track of what I've been doing with this project. A journal if you will. I primarily will list all the issues I've worked through up until this current day.

Mon Feb 11 14:52:44 MST 2019 - Problem with Finding Rules

	Rules, as I've set up this program to use, are each of the changes that will be used for each of the 'keywords' in current document. The only issue with this is that I'll have to have a unique card for each variable instead of one that can cover all of a single though. How do I fix this? Maybe a second parameter for the rule to check the current line to have that particular bit inside of it. I'll post an answer once I've got it figured out.

Mon Feb 11 21:30:08 MST 2019 - Came up with not the best solution, but one that works

	So what I did was seperate the problem into 2 databases: Constant keywords (like 'return' and 'function') from variable keyworks (like a function parameter or a numeric value). First, we'llry database (constant) which will have the names of the variables as a key. If not found, then we sequentially check the variable database which is based on a regex expression of the line given. If neithefound then it'll send a message to me. There still are many things that need to be worked out, but for now it's a working build... ish.

Tue Feb 12 16:27:24 MST 2019 - Implemented solution

	So I guess I figured it out. There might be some future bugs, but I think I have a few ways of solving those. One in particular is that the regex only checks if an expression is in the line instead of actually marking where. I suppose I could double up that with the 'index' and 'start' variables inside the program, but we'll address that issue when we get there. Till then, it's getting the database connected and testing that.

Thu Feb 14 22:27:12 MST 2019 - Got everything working. Including database

	So I was able to get the database finished and connected to the project so that's nice. I guess it's in full functionality right now. All I have to do is work out small bits of it, make it cleaner looking, finish the rules, and then I'm done. Of course theres a billion and one things I can do more, but I want a very basic build finished in the next few weeks so I candeploy and start data collecting. Tis important.

Mon Mar 11 12:08:56 MDT 2019 - Trying to get a new line saved into mongodb

	So there's a bit of a problem... whenever I try to save some html "pre-code" inside mongo (pre-code being a library to format code specifically on the page), it saves it as a string. However when I try to use it in the page, it renders it exactly as it's written, a nice property of the 'pre' tag. I have to find a way to override this or do something proper about it.
